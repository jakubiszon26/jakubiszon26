# Hello 👋🏻
I'm Jakub and I'm elementary school student.
I'm learning to code since I was 11, then I was learning c++. I did not like c++ much so i was looking for something better for me. I found C# and i have learned it's basics. But still that wasn't that what i was looking for. And finaly after some few other languages i found javascript. And that was exactly what i was looking for. I really like frontend, especially with React jS. I'm still learning so my code may be not the best for now but I hope it will getting better and better.
